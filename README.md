### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from a food delivery service to uncover insights and trends that can help improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The analysis includes examining customer behavior, order patterns, and delivery performance using various data science techniques.

### Objectives
- **Understand Customer Behavior:** Identify trends in ordering habits, peak order times, and popular items.
- **Analyze Delivery Performance:** Evaluate delivery times, identify bottlenecks, and suggest improvements.
- **Identify Key Metrics:** Determine key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average delivery time, order frequency, and customer ratings.

### Data
The dataset includes information on customer orders, delivery times, item details, and customer feedback. Key attributes in the dataset:
- Order ID
- Customer ID
- Order Date and Time
- Delivery Time
- Items Ordered
- Customer Ratings

### Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use statistical methods and visualizations to explore the data.
3. **Data Visualization:** Create charts and graphs to represent findings clearly.
4. **Insights and Recommendations:** Summarize key findings and provide actionable recommendations.

### Results
- **Customer Behavior:** Analysis shows peak ordering times during weekends and dinner hours. Popular items include pizzas and burgers.
- **Delivery Performance:** Average delivery time is 30 minutes, with delays mostly occurring during peak hours.
- **Key Metrics:** Average customer rating is 4.2 out of 5, indicating overall satisfaction.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.

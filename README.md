This project involves analyzing a dataset from a food delivery service to gain insights into customer behavior, order patterns, and delivery performance. Using Python, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover trends and identify key metrics. The project aims to provide actionable insights to improve service efficiency and customer satisfaction. Key libraries used include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Food Delivery Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from a food delivery service to uncover insights and trends that can enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The analysis explores customer behavior, order patterns, and delivery performance using various data science techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Understand Customer Behavior**: Identify trends in ordering habits, peak order times, and popular items.
- **Analyze Delivery Performance**: Evaluate delivery times, detect bottlenecks, and suggest improvements.
- **Identify Key Metrics**: Determine KPIs such as average delivery time, order frequency, and customer ratings.
